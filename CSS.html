    <p class=" helth_text">Health is a vital aspect of human life that encompasses physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It is a state
        of complete wellness, where an individual can function at their optimal level, free from disease, injury, or
        disability. Maintaining good health is crucial for leading a happy, productive, and fulfilling life.

        Physical health refers to the body's ability to function properly, with all organs and systems working in
        harmony. Regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and adequate sleep are essential for maintaining physical health.
        Engaging in physical activity, such as walking, running, or swimming, can help prevent chronic diseases like
        heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.

        Mental health, on the other hand, pertains to an individual's emotional and psychological well-being. It
        involves being able to handle stress, build strong relationships, and make healthy choices. Good mental health
        enables us to cope with challenges, adapt to change, and lead a purposeful life. Practicing mindfulness,
        meditation, and seeking social support can help maintain mental health.

    <p class="Yoga_text">Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India over 5,000 years ago. The
        word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj" meaning "to unite" or "to join." It aims to unite the body, mind,
        and spirit, promoting overall health and well-being.

        Yoga combines physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation to balance the body's
        energy. Regular practice can improve flexibility, strength, balance, and coordination. It also reduces stress,
        anxiety, and depression by releasing endorphins and promoting relaxation.

        Yoga is not just a physical practice but also a philosophical one. It teaches us to cultivate awareness,
        acceptance, and compassion. It encourages us to live in the present moment, letting go of past regrets and
        future worries.

        With its numerous benefits, yoga has become a popular practice worldwide. Whether you're seeking physical,
        mental, or spiritual growth, yoga has something to offer. So, take a deep breath, roll out your mat, and
        experience the transformative power of yoga for yourself.</p>
